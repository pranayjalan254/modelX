# ModelX: Decentralized AI/ML Model Marketplace

**ModelX** is a decentralized marketplace where developers can upload, share, and monetize their AI/ML models, while users can access premium models on a pay-per-prompt basis. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized cloud platforms, **ModelX** ensures security, transparency, and scalability for both model creators and users.

## Features

- **Decentralized Hosting**: AI/ML models are hosted across decentralized networks like IPFS and Akash, ensuring greater security and availability.
- **Pay-per-Prompt Access**: Users pay only for the prompts they use, making AI more affordable and accessible.
- **Blockchain Integration**: All transactions are tracked and verified using blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and ownership.
- **Model Monetization**: Developers can monetize their models by offering them for use on the platform, earning revenue based on usage.
- **On-Demand AI Models**: Access a wide variety of models from NLP (like GPT-4) to computer vision models, tailored to your needs.

## How It Works
